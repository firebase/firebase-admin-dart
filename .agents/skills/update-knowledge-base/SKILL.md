description: Updates the knowledge base in .agents/knowledge (an Open Knowledge Format bundle of this repository's decisions, divergences from the Node.js SDK and constraints). Use when a change makes a concept wrong, when a change adds or reverses a decision, or when ./scripts/knowledge.sh check fails.

# Update the knowledge base

`.agents/knowledge/` holds concepts: the architectural decisions, divergences from the Node.js Admin SDK, and repository constraints. Topics that govern the same files and are read together share one concept. Agents read a concept before editing the files it `governs`. A concept that no longer matches the code misleads every agent after you, so fix it in the same PR as the change.

The code and its docs are the source of truth. A concept holds only what they don't say: the why, what Node.js does, rules that span files, process that isn't in the code, traps, and rejected alternatives. For everything else, it points to where the knowledge lives.

## 1. Find the concepts your change touches

```bash
./scripts/knowledge.sh for <each path you changed>
```

Read each concept listed. If your change makes anything in one untrue, edit it. If your change is a new decision, divergence or constraint that an agent could get wrong, add it to the concept that already governs those files, as a `## <topic>` subsection under each section, or add a concept if none fits.

## 2. Edit or add a concept

Copy the shape of an existing concept of the same `type`. Keep the frontmatter's indentation: `scripts/knowledge.sh` parses it. Write `governs` and `sources` as block lists, with one `  - ` item per line and each source's keys indented four spaces. `check` rejects the inline `[...]` and `{...}` forms.

- **Frontmatter:**
  - `type`: `Decision`, `Divergence` (how Dart differs from Node), `Constraint` (a rule the repo enforces or expects) or `Playbook`.
  - `title`: up to 60 characters.
  - `description`: one sentence in the present tense.
  - `tags`.
  - `agents_md`: `always` if AGENTS.md must state the rule; `when-touching` if it matters only when editing the governed files; `reference` for a concept with no `governs`.
  - `governs`: path globs from the repo root. Keep them narrow, so that `for` lists only concepts that matter.
  - `sources`: the durable places that show or enforce the concept.
    - A repo file is given as a path relative to the concept file, with `symbol:` set to a literal string the file must contain.
    - A Node.js file is given as a GitHub URL on the default branch.
    - No line numbers and no commit SHAs.
- **Don't restate what the code says.** If the code, its dartdoc, a README, CONTRIBUTING.md or a workflow already says it (lists of fields, codes, files, jobs or steps; what a function does; a value), add a source and point to it instead. A copy drifts; a pointer is checked.
- **Body sections:** every concept starts with `# Where it lives`:
  - 1 to 5 bullets per topic, each written as "what — `symbol` in `file`" and footnoted to a source.
  - The first bullet names what enforces the rule, if anything: "Enforced by: `<test, job, lint or table>`", or "Enforced by: nothing; review only."

  Then, by type:
  - Decision: `# Decision`, `# Why`, `# Rules for agents`, `# Related`. Add an optional `# Node.js` paragraph when Node does it differently.
  - Divergence: `# Node.js`, `# Dart`, `# Why`, `# Rules for agents`, `# Related`.
  - Constraint: `# Constraint`, `# Why`, `# Rules for agents`, `# Related`. Add the optional `# Node.js` paragraph here too.
  - Playbook: `# When to use`, `# Steps`, `# Related`.
- **Rules for agents** start with **Must:**, **Must not:**, **Should:** or **Ask first:**. Make each rule only as strong as its evidence.
- **Why:** label the reason honestly.
  - "The maintainers' stated reason: …" when a maintainer said it.
  - "The likely reason (not recorded): …" when it's inferred.
  - "The reason isn't recorded. Ask a maintainer before changing it." when nobody knows.
- **Timeless:** concepts state what is true and why, not how it got there.
  - No pull request or issue numbers, commit SHAs, dates, names, release versions used as history, or "now" and "currently". `check` rejects `#123`-style references, "PR 123", pull and issue URLs, and dates.
  - For a value the code holds, such as a version constraint or a threshold, point to where it lives instead of copying it.
- **Links** between concepts use bundle-relative paths, e.g. `[Title](/firestore/standalone-package.md)`.
- **Footnotes** attribute a claim to one of the concept's sources: `[^source-id]`, where `source-id` is a `sources` entry's `id`. Define each footnote at the end of the body. `check` fails on a footnote that names no source, and on a repo source no footnote cites, so every pointer stays tied to a checked file and symbol.
- **Where it lives:** every code name in a bullet must appear in a file that bullet footnotes. `check` fails otherwise, and it is the check authors hit first.

- **Provenance (optional):** when a maintainer has checked a concept against the code, they can add `verified: { by: human:<github-login>, at: <UTC time> }`. A concept nobody has verified stays unverified, and that's allowed. Don't record which tool or model wrote a concept.

A reversed decision isn't deleted. Set `status: deprecated`, say what replaced it, and link the new concept, so agents don't re-propose the old way. Remove its `governs:` key along with its globs (an empty `governs:` fails `check`), so `for` stops listing it, and keep only the `sources` that still exist, or drop `sources` entirely.

## 3. Regenerate and check

```bash
./scripts/knowledge.sh index   # rewrites index.md from the frontmatter
./scripts/knowledge.sh check   # what CI runs
```

If the concept is `agents_md: always`, check that AGENTS.md's rule still matches it.
